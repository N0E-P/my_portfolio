					In November 2021, I've stupidly bought the top of the crypto market. But I
					didn't give up, waited patiently 1,5 years to learn trading and understand
					market cycles. Then bought back Bitcoin at 24k. Now I have multiplied my initial
					investment, and took the opportunity to bought dips to make greater profits
					along the way.

					In August 2024, I bought a ton of used bikes. Some were in okay conditions, and
					some were really really bad. I then fixed them during my holidays, set up a
					carrefully written sales pages for each of them, and sold them usually around
					100â‚¬ each. As a result: I got more money to invest, I learned a lot about bikes,
					mechanics and especially selling and negociation.
