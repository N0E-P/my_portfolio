					In November 2021, I've stupidly bought the top of the crypto market. But I
					didn't give up, patiently waited 1,5 years to learn trading and understand
					market cycles. Then I bought back Bitcoin at 24k. Now I have multiplied my
					initial investment, and used the opportunity to buy dips to make bigger profits
					along the way.

					In August 2024, I bought a ton of used bikes. Some were in okay condition, and
					some were really, really bad. I then fixed them up during my holidays, set up a
					carefully written sales page for each one, and sold them, usually for around
					100â‚¬ each. As a result: I got more money to invest, I learned a lot about bikes,
					mechanics and especially about selling and negotiating.
